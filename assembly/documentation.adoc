== Tool and Part List
NOTE   : Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

WARNING: Safety is utmost important, make sure you don't hurt yourself when using the tools. Wear safety equipments.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen Head.

image:tools.jpg[640,480,width=150%,scaledwidth=70%]

Should have

* Ballhead imbus screwdriver, Allen keys
* Phillip Screwdriver


== Assembly

Assembly is done in several steps.
Although there are many possible ways to assemble,
we recommend the order given in the manual.

=== Part 0. Overview
The assembly of the Gretchen head is divided into 3 main parts. First, we need to assemble the base of the Gretchen head.
The base of the Gretchen head contains a single motor allowing the robot to move left and right. Second, add on to the assembled base by assembling the upper part of the Gretchen head.
The upper part of the Gretchen head also contains a single motor that allows the robot to move up and down. Finally, we have to attach the board that controls the motors to the Gretchen head.
*When reading the instructions, you should enlarge the images.* You would want to left click on the image. A new tab will open up with an oversized image. You can right click on the oversized image and click "View Image."
Then, the image should fit your screen.
