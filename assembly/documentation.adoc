== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen Head.

Should have picture

* Cable stripper
* Crimp tool
* Ballhead imbus screwdriver, Allen keys
* Long nose plier
* Snipper
* Soldering iron & Solder

== Assembly

Assembly is done in several steps.
Although there are many possible ways to assemble,
we recommend the order given in the manual.

=== Step 0. Overview
The assembly of the Gretchen head is divided into 2 main parts. First, we need to assemble the base of the grethen head.
The base of the gretchen head contains a single motor allowing the robot to move left and right. Second, we assemble the upper part of the gretchen head.
The upper part also contains a single motor that allows the robot to move up and down.

=== Step 1. Assemble the base
*Overview*: We will be assembling the base of the Gretchen head. We will be attaching a motor and a sensoriboard to the base.

*Instruction*

4.1.1 Attach the M4x16 nut and bolt loosely on to the servo motor.

4.1.2 Insert the motor into the ABGH1 3D printed part

4.1.3 Screw the bolt while holding the nut so that the motor is tightly attached to ABGH1

4.1.4 Insert the remaining bolt and nut into the motor and ABGH1

4.1.5 Tighten the bolt and nut

Attach the base part to the servo. The servo should be movable in ~90° in both
directions.

=== Step 5. Assemble and attach the upper part of the Gretchen Head to base

Overview: We assemble the upper part of the Gretchen Head and x-horn of the servo.

| image::IMG_999.jpg[160,120] | If the hole is too big, you can use a longer bolt (M2 x15) and nut to hold them in place.
|====

5.2 Combine ABGH3 with ABGH4.

5.3 Attach the upper part to the servo on base.

    * The servo should be movable in ~90 degress in both directions.

    * Try moving the upper part attached to the motor left and right to find the middle

    * Unscrew and screw to adjust the upper part to the middle
