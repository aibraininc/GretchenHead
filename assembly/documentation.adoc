== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen Head.

Should have picture

== Assembly

Assembly is done in several steps.
Although there are many possible ways to assemble,
we recommend the order given in the manual.

=== Step 0. Overview
The assembly of the Gretchen head is divided into 3 main parts. Frist, we will be preparing the motors. We have to attach a board called sensoriboard to the motor.
Sensoriboads allows the computer to control the motor and get feed back from the motor. Second, we need to assemble the base of the grethen head.
The base of the gretchen head contains a single motor allowing the robot to move left and right. Third, we assemble the upper part of the gretchen head.
The upper part also contains a single motor that allows the robot to move up and down.

=== Step 1. Prepare the cables connecting the sensoriboards and the motors
*Overview*: We need to connect the sensoriboards and the motors. This is done by creating a cable. The cable needs to be prepared.
The sensoriboard will be connected to the cable through a molex, and the motor will be connected directly. For the cable to be connected to the molex,
the cable needs to have crimp connectors.
